                            Rhythm notation and reading music.<br>
                            Learn how to read and write rhythms, get familiar with the different types of notes and rests, how long they all last and most importantly, what they all sound like.<br>
                            Suitable for candidates preparing for ABRSM Grade 1 music theory. Rhythm is one of the most important parts of modern music notation and is a fundamental part of music theory.<br>
                            Rhythmic lengths are usually represented by differences in the head or tail of a note. This music theory lesson will get you familiar with the most common types of notes, which are as follows.

                            Learn the patterns for writing out any major scale as well as figuring out major key signatures and tonic triads.<br>
                            Suitable for candidates preparing for ABRSM Grade 2 music theory. Tonality is the musical concept of a hierarchy of pitches related to a centre pitch, or tonic.<br>
                            This music theory lesson explains how major keys and scales work.

                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qi6uuhU1unk?si=8B9ET0hN5ouIovBC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <p>Easily understand the difference between simple and compound time.<br>
                            Learn all about duple, triple and quadruple meters, how to correctly group beats and how to tell if something is in simple time or compound time using this helpful chart.<br>
                            Suitable for candidates preparing for ABRSM Grade 3 music theory. Time signatures tell us how many beats are contained in each bar and which note value is equivalent to a beat.<br>
                            Time signatures consist of two numbers. The lower number indicates a rhythmic duration - 2 is a Minim (Half Note), 4 is a Crotchet (Quarter Note), 8 is a Quaver (Eighth Note) and 16 is a Semiquaver (Sixteenth Note).<br>
                            The number above shows how many of them there are in a bar. Music that has two beats (of any rhythmic duration) is said to be in "duple time". Music with three beats is in "triple time" and music with four beats is in "quadruple time".<br>
                            This music theory lesson explains the difference between simple time and compound time.

                            Suitable for candidates preparing for ABRSM Grade 4 music theory. The standard orchestra is a combination of musicians made up of four sections of instruments: string, brass, woodwind, and percussion.<br>
                            When we talk about musical instruments, we often talk about them as being part of a family.

                        <p>
                            Find out how to draw the Circle of Fifths and why it's so incredibly useful!<br>
                            Learn how to use the circle of fifths to work out all the major keys, all the minor keys and all their key signatures.<br>
                            When it comes to music theory, the circle of fifths is one of the most important concepts you can learn.<br>
                            Useful for notation, transposition, understanding key signatures, and familiarising yourself with the general structure of music, it is well worth your time to add the circle of fifths to your vault of music theory knowledge.<br>
                            The circle of fifths can seem a little overwhelming at first, but you will soon realise how easy it really is to understand. The circle of fifths is the relationship among the 12 tones of the chromatic scale, their corresponding key signatures, and the associated major and minor keys.
